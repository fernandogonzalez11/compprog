obs:

k between 1 and n
wanna minimize
could always be n
can be even/odd
when you or many elements you can only get up to 2^(log2(max))-1

1 -> only works if all elements same
2 -> 0 1 1, 0 1 0, 1 0 1, ..., basically 1 elem changing
3 -> 0 1 2, 

0 1 2 -> 3

hyp:
something to do with distinct elems?

0 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0
our "window" must cover all distinct elements?
    - all elements that contribute bits to the or
  
our "window" must have enough elements st their bits combined 


sol:
sliding window? how do i reverse or? -> too difficult
prefix&suffix ors? same issue ^
